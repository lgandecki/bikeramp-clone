### Installation
To install all necessary modules type `npm install`

### Starting application
`npm start`

### Starting unit tests
`npm test`

### Starting end to end tests
Before starting end to end tests we need to run application (`npm start`)

After that you can run end to end tests `npm runt test:endtoend`

_If your end to end tests fail - please restart your app and try again. End to end tests assume a clean state. (similarly to how it would work in a CI)_
